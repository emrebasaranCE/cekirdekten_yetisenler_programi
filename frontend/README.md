# Why Frontend Doesn't Work Properly?

To be honest, I didnt have any prior knowladge about this framework which was a negative for me. Even tho I manage to handle backend, I wasn't lucky at the frontend. I am saying this because I am afraid i wasn't able to finish frontend. If you use `docker compose up -d` you will see some basic html with map.
